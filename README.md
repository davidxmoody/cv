## About Me

Senior full-stack software engineer with a strong background in TypeScript/React and production backend systems.

Experienced building data-rich mobile and web applications. Capable of working effectively on complex projects both alone and with a team.

I particularly enjoy visualising data and have hands-on experience with Python, data-analysis and AI through side-projects.

## Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer at Candide (Oct 2017 - Nov 2021)

I worked at Candide as it grew from approx 5 employees to 50. The original goal of Candide was to create an "everything app" for all things related to plants and gardening. It was a social network but also had a plant database, AI plant identification, buying/selling, garden audio tours, ticketing and more.

I worked on a little bit of everything, sometimes as the lead/solo dev on a new feature and sometimes with a larger team. Some of my main contributions included:

- Creating a new CMS for managing plant and app data:
    - With a need to replace a legacy Laravel system, I created a new custom React/GraphQL/Node.js based CMS
    - I significantly improved the quality of our web-scraped plant data including: creating a JSON Schema based editing form, migrating from CouchDB to Postgres and analysing/fixing a lot of the data
    - I created the tools for staff to author app/website content and moderate user content
    - I worked closely with a remote product owner and content editors to add new features and save them as much time as possible

- Creating and maintaining features in the React Native app:
    - I worked closely with designers and product owners to create many new app features
    - I created the frontend for Plant ID (taking a photo, uploading it and seeing results)
    - I created the initial frontend for garden memberships (including Stripe integration)
    - I created the initial frontend for users to buy/sell/trade plants in app (including integration with a third party chat system)
    - I greatly improved the usability of uploading images/videos for social network posts (including background uploads, progress bars and better error handling)
    - I also did a lot of maintenance work including: React Native version upgrades, app store releases, writing/fixing UI tests and improving code quality (for example introducing React hooks and eliminating a lot of dead code)

- Backend work:
    - We used GraphQL for our public APIs supported by TypeScript/Node.js micro-services and Postgres on GCP
    - I initially worked with others to create new routes and design database schemas
    - I later created several new micro-services/databases by myself
    - I deployed at least one thing into production on most days

- Working with a team to create services for public gardens:
    - We created a ticketing solution for gardens (user buys on website, garden owner scans QR code and views all tickets in a CMS)
    - We worked with gardens to create audio tours, initially in the React Native app and later as a Progressive Web App with Leaflet maps and offline capability
    - We created an interactive map for finding nearby public gardens
    - We visited many gardens to talk to owners and test audio tours

- Creating dashboards with SQL and Google Data Studio:
    - Before we had proper dashboards in place, I ran hundreds of manual SQL queries to answer data questions for stakeholders
    - I helped to introduce Data Studio and created many dashboards to answer questions about user behaviour and Plant ID accuracy
    - I later gained experience working with data scientists and using BigQuery and Google Analytics

- Working on a Next.js website:
    - I worked with designers to create marketing pages and render selected app content
    - I created a new website header to unify pages that were previously using two different conflicting component libraries

- Creating new things during "hack days":
    - A game using Plant ID for finding plants at the Eden Project
    - A game for finding wild flowers in Leigh Woods
    - An algorithm for showing your GPS position on not-to-scale illustrated garden maps
    - Lots of different ways to visualise plant and user data

### Software Engineer at Momentum Financial Technology (Mar 2015 - Aug 2017)

I joined as the only engineer on a project to redesign a consumer finance website. I worked closely with designers and marketers in an agile cross-functional team.

- I created a new static website and set up a cloud-based CMS
- It included several complex financial tools built with React and third party APIs
- I created a React/Redux based investment advice tool and gave a lightning talk about it at a BristolJS meetup and then later gave another talk on Redux

I then switched to a larger team working on a React app for aggregating personal finance information from multiple banks and connecting to financial advisors.

- I worked on developing new UI components and features for the app and CMS
- I introduced two big new technologies into the project: CSS modules (to replace Sass) and React Storybook (a tool for developing components in isolation)
- I participated in multiple Design Sprints to help design new features

From Aug 2016 to Aug 2017 I ran the CodeHub Hack Night meetups every two weeks in the MFT offices. I also attended approx 150+ tech meetups and conferences from 2015 to 2020 (BristolJS, Bristech, Bristol Web Perf, CodeHub, PyData, SW Mobile and more).
