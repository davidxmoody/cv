## About Me

Versatile software engineer with extensive experience in full-stack app development. Spent the last few years working on side projects to learn Python and other AI/data-science things.

## Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer at Candide (Oct 2017 - Nov 2021)

I worked at Candide as it grew from approx 5 employees to 50. The original goal of Candide was to create an "everything app" for all things related to plants and gardening. It was a social network but also had a plant database, AI plant identification, buying/selling, garden audio tours, ticketing and more.

I worked on a little bit of everything, sometimes as the lead/solo dev on a new feature or sometimes with a larger team. Some of those things included:

- Creating a new CMS for managing plant and app data
  - **TypeScript** and **React** frontend
  - **TypeScript**, **GraphQL**, **Postgres**, **Docker** and **Google Cloud** backend

- Creating and maintaining features in the **React Native** app
  - **TypeScript**, **GraphQL**, image/video uploads, **Stripe** payments, push notifications, UI tests and more

- Working on a **Next.js** website

- Creating dashboards with **SQL** and **Google Data Studio**

- Working on experimental projects
  - **Progressive Web Apps** using **Leaflet** maps for garden audio tours
  - Games using plant ID for finding plants at the Eden Project and local forest trails

### Software Engineer at Momentum Financial Technology (Mar 2015 - Aug 2017)

I initially worked as the only dev on a project to redesign a consumer finance website. It was a static website using a cloud-based CMS and included several **React** financial calculators.

I later switched to a team working on a **React** app called Moneyhub for aggregating personal finance information from multiple banks.
