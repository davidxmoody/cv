## About me

Versatile software engineer with extensive experience in full-stack app development and some experience working with AI projects and data. Spent the last couple of years working on side projects to learn Python and other AI and deep learning technologies.

## Professional experience

### Senior software engineer at Candide (Oct 2017 - Nov 2021)

I worked at Candide as it grew from approx 5 employees to 50. The original goal of Candide was to create an "everything app" for all things related to plants and gardening. It was a social network but also had an extensive plant database, plant identification, buying/selling, garden audio tours and more. Unfortunately the app has since closed down.

I worked on a little bit of everything, often as the lead/solo dev on a new feature or sometimes with a larger team. Some of those things included:

- AI plant identification
  - Creating tools to scrape and tag plant images
  - Creating the app frontend for uploading photos and viewing results
  - Learning a lot about machine learning concepts and implementations

- Creating a CMS for managing plant and app data
  - TypeScript/React frontend, TypeScript/GraphQL/Postgres/micro-services backend
  - Fixing and migrating scraped plant data

- Creating and maintaining features in the React Native app

- Creating dashboards with Google Data Studio and Postgres

- Other experimental features
  - An algorithm to show GPS positions on not-to-scale hand-drawn garden maps
  - A game using plant ID where you had to find plants at the Eden Project
  - A game where you had to find wild flowers on a trail in Leigh Woods
  - Research into content recommendation systems

### Software engineer at Momentum Financial Technology (Mar 2015 - Aug 2017)

I joined the company as a front-end web developer. I initially worked as the only dev on a project to redesign a consumer finance website. It also included several React based financial calculators/tools.

I later switched to a team working on an app called Moneyhub for aggregating personal finance information from multiple banks.

## Projects related to AI

- [Cascadia AI](https://github.com/davidxmoody/cascadia-ai)
  - An AI algorithm I created to play the board game Cascadia
  - Uses PyTorch to train a neural network for predicting the future rewards of a game state
  - Training data for the model generated from simulating games with a simpler greedy algorithm

- [Railroad Ink AI](https://github.com/davidxmoody/railroad-ink-ai)
  - A playable web-based implementation of the board game Railroad Ink and an AI algorithm to play it
  - The algorithm was inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search using many random simulations to explore a depth-limited tree
  - Also experimented with Naive Bayes classifiers and neural networks (although they never performed as well as the simulation method)

- [Apple Watch data analysis](https://github.com/davidxmoody/self-tracking)
  - A collection of Python scripts to import and graph data from an Apple Health export and other sources
  - Uses Pandas, Plotly and Matplotlib

- [Kaggle](https://github.com/davidxmoody/kaggle)
  - My solutions to a few of the beginner Kaggle machine-learning challenges

- [Monte Carlo Tree Search in Texas Hold'em poker](https://github.com/davidxmoody/mctsbot?tab=readme-ov-file)
  - Third year uni dissertation project
  - Built a working poker bot using MCTS and Naive Bayes classifiers

## Other projects

- [Advent of Code](https://github.com/davidxmoody/advent-of-code)
  - My solutions to the popular coding challenges in multiple languages including Python, Typescript and SQL

- [Life-calendar](https://github.com/davidxmoody/life-calendar)
  - Progressive web app for visualising the weeks in a human lifetime and also displaying different layers of health/habit data

- [Professor P website/games](https://github.com/davidxmoody/professorp.co.uk)
  - Website and 5 JavaScript games for a series of children's books

- [Old blog](https://github.com/davidxmoody/davidxmoody.com)
  - Some stuff I wrote in 2014-2016 (mostly about programming)

- [Metalsmith broken link checker](https://github.com/davidxmoody/metalsmith-broken-link-checker)
  - Tool for detecting broken links in a static website

- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/davidxmoody/dotfiles)
  - Personal config files for Neovim, bash, git, tmux, etc.
